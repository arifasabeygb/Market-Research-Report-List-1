<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The File Integrity Monitoring Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Agent-based</li><li>Agent-less</li></ul></p>
<p><p>File Integrity Monitoring (FIM) consists of two primary market types: agent-based and agent-less solutions. Agent-based FIM installs software directly on target systems, enabling real-time monitoring and providing comprehensive insights into file changes. This method is highly effective but may consume system resources. In contrast, agent-less FIM leverages existing network protocols to monitor files remotely, minimizing system impact and simplifying deployment. However, it may offer less granularity in monitoring compared to agent-based solutions, making each suitable for different organizational needs.</p></p>
