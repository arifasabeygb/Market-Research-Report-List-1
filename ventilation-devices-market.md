<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Ventilation Devices Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Non-invasive Ventilator</li><li>Invasive Ventilator</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The ventilation devices market consists of two main types: non-invasive ventilators and invasive ventilators. Non-invasive ventilators aid breathing through methods like masks or nasal prongs, providing support without intubation, making them useful for conditions like COPD or sleep apnea. Invasive ventilators, on the other hand, require intubation, delivering respiratory support directly into the patient's airway, commonly used in critical care settings for severe respiratory failure or during surgeries. Both types cater to varying patient needs and healthcare scenarios.</p></p>
